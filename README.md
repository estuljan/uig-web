## Uyghur Interactive Glossary

UIG Web is a Next.js 16 (Pages Router) app that renders the Uyghur Interactive Glossary. The landing page (`src/pages/index.tsx`) statically fetches vocabulary from the Payload CMS running at `https://admin.uig.me` (or any endpoint you configure) and showcases Uyghur, English, and Turkish translations with optional pronunciation audio. Tailwind CSS v4 styles live in `src/styles/globals.css`.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (align with Vercel/Next 16 requirements)
- `pnpm` 8+ (lockfile committed)
- Access to a Payload CMS instance seeded with the glossary collection

---

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

The repo uses two-space indentation, double quotes, and arrow-function components—match that style when contributing.

---

## Environment Configuration

Create `.env.local` at the project root with at least one CMS base URL:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_BASE_URL=https://admin.uig.me
# Optional server-only fallback:
# CMS_BASE_URL=https://admin.uig.me
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_BASE_URL` is shared by server and client bundles and is the preferred override.
- `CMS_BASE_URL` exists as a server-only fallback when you cannot expose the URL publicly.
- When neither variable is set, the code falls back to `https://admin.uig.me` (`src/pages/index.tsx:21-35`), so the glossary still renders using published entries but you cannot preview draft content.

If you self-host Payload, ensure it exposes `/api/words?depth=1` and that authentication (if any) allows public reads or that you proxy the request.

## CMS Schema Primer

The UI expects the Payload “Word” collection to match `src/interfaces/word.ts`:

| Field           | Type                      | Notes                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `word_uyghur`   | string (required)         | Main Uyghur spelling                                                  |
| `word_english`  | string (required)         | English translation                                                   |
| `word_turkish`  | string (required)         | Turkish translation                                                   |
| `pronunciation` | media relation or string | Optional audio clip; code resolves relative `/media/*` paths or URLs  |

Audio playback is handled via `resolvePronunciationUrl` in `src/pages/index.tsx:44-78`. Provide either an absolute URL or a Payload media field whose `url`/`filename` points to `/media/...`.

## Running & Scripts

| Command       | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`    | Starts `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload.                         |
| `pnpm build`  | Runs the production Next compiler and TypeScript checks.                |
| `pnpm start`  | Serves the `.next` output (simulate production).                        |
| `pnpm lint`   | Runs ESLint 9 with the Next config.                                     |

API routes live under `src/pages/api`. You can confirm the boilerplate endpoint after `pnpm dev` with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hello
```

## Manual QA Checklist

Because we do not ship automated tests yet (`package.json` has no `test` script), add notes for these flows in every PR:

1. **Glossary render** – With a fresh `pnpm build && pnpm start`, confirm CMS words appear and match the configured base URL.
2. **Search filtering** – Type Uyghur and English terms; results should filter in real time.
3. **Pronunciation audio** – Verify play/pause toggling and that the active row resets when audio ends.
4. **CMS override** – Document which `NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_BASE_URL` you used and whether the payload required authentication.
5. **Fallback behavior** – Temporarily point the env var to an unreachable host; ensure the UI falls back to the hardcoded sample list and logs the fetch failure.

---

## Deployment Notes

- Production deploys (Vercel, Docker, etc.) must provide `NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_BASE_URL` via environment variables. Without it, the site will default to the public CMS and only show published entries.
- `next.config.ts` enables `reactStrictMode` and `output: "standalone"`, so the project can be containerized directly after `pnpm build`.
- If the CMS is down or misconfigured, `getStaticProps` throws (`src/pages/index.tsx:80-100`), and ISR will keep serving the last successful glossary. Watch build logs for “Failed to fetch glossary words from CMS.”

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Network errors during build** – Verify the CMS host allows connections from your build environment. For protected instances, expose a read-only endpoint or run builds within the same network.
- **Audio not playing** – Confirm the media asset returns `Content-Type: audio/*` and that CORS headers allow the origin. Absolute URLs are safest.
- **Tailwind styles missing** – Ensure `src/styles/globals.css` is imported in `_app.tsx` (already wired) and that you did not remove the PostCSS/Tailwind pipeline.

With the CMS configured and env vars in place, contributors can install dependencies, run `pnpm dev`, and start iterating on the glossary immediately.
